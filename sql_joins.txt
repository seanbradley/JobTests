ACID = Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability

1NF = one value only in each cell; primary key
2NF = no partial functional dependencies (a non-key column depends on some but not all columns that comprise a composite primary key)
3NF = no transitive dependencies (a non-key column is related to another non-key column)

()
inner join = what is common to table A and table B

SELECT * FROM TableA
INNER JOIN TableB
ON TableA.name = TableB.name


(  )
full outer join = everything in both table A and table B

SELECT * FROM TableA
FULL OUTER JOIN TableB
ON TableA.name = TableB.name


(()
left outer join = everything in table A, and whatever table B has in common with table A

SELECT * FROM TableA
LEFT OUTER JOIN TableB
ON TableA.name = TableB.name


(
left outer join with 'WHERE TableB.id IS null' clause = everything in table A that is not in table B

SELECT * FROM TableA
LEFT OUTER JOIN TableB
ON TableA.name = TableB.name
WHERE TableB.id IS null


(())
left outer join with 'WHERE TableB.id IS null OR TableA.id IS null' clause = everything in table A; everything in table B...but nothing that either table has in common.

SELECT * FROM TableA
FULL OUTER JOIN TableB
ON TableA.name = TableB.name
WHERE TableA.id IS null
OR TableB.id IS null


()()
crossjoin = everything in both tables

SELECT * FROM TableA
CROSS JOIN TableB
