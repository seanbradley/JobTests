This is a collection of interview related questions and tests I've
received in the last couple years--as well as notes I've compiled 
for myself to remember commonly asked for demonstrations of Python
knowledge. 

You can find problems akin to some of these at...
 
https://projecteuler.net 

...but some of the problems herein are rather original and/or specific.

I think, at minimum, my notes, and answers to most of the challenges
herein ought to be in easy grasp of one's memory prior to walking into
a whiteboard test situation. Such tests usually tend to be _much_ more 
difficult. There is little to nothing here regarding--for instance--data 
types, efficiency of algorithms--and/or higher level computer science...
all of which is fair game in the interview process. 

I make no claim whatsover that my answers are, by any means, the best or 
most intelligent. In fact, some were met with patent disapproval by my
interviewers, even if the associated code worked. Neither do I make 
representation that these particular test questions are the ones you'll 
most likley encounter in your own job search.

For self-taught programmers and/or those seeking a refresher, I can 
recommend the Ars Digita University courses available on SD Drive here:

http://aduni.org/drives/

It provides a nice overview of undergraduate computer science compressed
into a year long curriculum, and presents salient topics via highly cogent 
and well taught videos. Similar courses and videos abound on the web.

Also, the most popular beginning Python course can be found here:

Finally, an great Javascript tutorial can be found here:

Feel free to contact me with questions, and/or even to suggest more optimal
solutions than those suggested herein. Additional questions you've 
encountered are also welcome.
