This is a collection of interview related questions and tests I've
received in the last couple years--as well as notes I've compiled 
for myself to remember commonly asked for demonstrations of Python
knowledge. 

You can find problems akin to some of these at...
 
https://projecteuler.net 

...but some of the problems herein are rather original and/or specific.

If you're looking for a compendium of actual technical interview questions,

The site's founder, Gayle Laakmann McDowell, provides some good strategies
for whiteboard interviews.

I think, at minimum, my notes, and answers to most of the challenges
herein ought to be in easy grasp of one's memory prior to walking into
any interview situation involving interacting with live human beings. 
Such tests usually tend to be much more difficult than tests administered
via e-mail, or, for which, the interviewee has any length of unsupervised
time to complete. There is little to nothing in this repo regarding--for instance--data types, efficiency of algorithms--and/or higher level computer science...all of which is fair game in the interview process. 

I make no claim whatsover that my answers are, by any means, the best or 
most intelligent. In fact, some were met with patent disapproval by my
interviewers, even if the associated code worked. Neither do I make 
representation that these particular test questions are the ones you'll 
most likley encounter in your own job search.

For self-taught programmers and/or those seeking a refresher, I can 
recommend the Ars Digita University courses available on SD Drive here:

http://aduni.org/drives/

The courseware provides a nice overview of undergraduate computer science 
compressed into a year long curriculum, and presents salient topics via 
highly cogent and well taught videos. Similar courses and videos abound 
on the web.

Also, the most popular beginning Python course is probably Zed Shaw's, 
and it can be found here:

Advanced Python tutors and masterclasses can also be found all over,
but here are two reputable sources:

Jeff Knupp

Dave Beazley

Finally, a great Javascript tutorial--recommended by CDBaby's founder, Derek Sivers--can be found here:

And a Javascript masterclass here:

Feel free to contact me with questions, and/or even to suggest more optimal
solutions than those suggested herein. Additional questions you've 
encountered are also welcome.
